# Checkbox

Did you read *Link* chapter? If you did not, please read it first. I explained a lot of basics there. If you did read it, good job. Continue with the good work.

Checkbox's HTML can look like like this:

    <input type="checkbox">

You can access the it with:

     browser.checkbox(how, what)

The *how* part can be (alphabetically): `after?`, `class`, `css`, `html`, `id`, `index`, `name`, `title`, `xpath` and multiple attributes.

Since I have gone into great detail there how to access links in the *Link* chapter, I will assume that you are familiar with all that stuff, and here I will just talk about things that are different for checkboxes. Take a look at *Checkbox* table in *Reference* chapter for more examples.
