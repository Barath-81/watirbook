# Headless

TODO

There are at least two ways to run browser in a headless mode. One is to use [Xvfb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb) (X virtual framebuffer) and [Headless](https://github.com/leonid-shevtsov/headless) gem, but that works only on Linux. Another option is to use a headless browser like [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/). This chapter will explain how to do both, and when you should consider one or the other option.
