# Continuous Integration

TODO

There is only limited value in running tests here and there on your local machine. The best way to run tests is as frequently as possible using a continuous integration tool like [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) or [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/). In this chapter you will learn how to set up hosted Jenkins at [CloudBees](http://www.cloudbees.com/) and Travis CI.
