# Ruby Tools

TODO

You will be writing a lot of Ruby code. It is beyond scope of this book to teach Ruby, so if you are not familiar with it, you should read a [book or two](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/) about it. You should also get familiar with Ruby tools like [IRB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Ruby_Shell), [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/), [Bundler](http://bundler.io), [RDoc](http://rdoc.info/), [RVM](http://rvm.io) and [The Ruby Toolbox](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com).
