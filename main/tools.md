You will have to learn how to use [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) since you will be spending a lot of time there. You will be spending a lot of time typing text so picking up a good text editor like [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) or IDE (integrated development environment) like [RubyMine](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby) will help. You will also be changing the code a lot so learning how to use a [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control) tool like [Git](http://git-scm.com) is important. A lot of tools that are mentioned in this book are hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com), Git hosting service.
