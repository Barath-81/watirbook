# Test Frameworks

TODO

While writing tests, you will need a way to set up the environment before the test, clean up after the test, create reports after all tests are executed and similar tasks. There is no need to implement that functionality yourself because Ruby has a lot of good and mature test frameworks. Two really popular ones are [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/) and [RSpec](http://rspec.info/).
