# Getting Help

TODO

How to get help might be most important thing to learn. In general good resources are [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com), [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) and project web sites.

It might seem almost a joke that project web sites are mentioned, but all the time I see people asking for help without doing even the basic research. Also, common pattern is asking for help in the wrong place. You will not get good support asking for help with Selenium on a general purpose Ruby mailing list, or asking a basic Ruby question at a Selenium mailing list. You have to learn enough Ruby to know where the language (Ruby) ends and where a library (like Selenium) starts.

It is really important that you learn where you can get more information. A good start is [selenium-webdriver](https://rubygems.org/gems/selenium-webdriver) gem page at [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org/). You will find links to it's [homepage](http://selenium.googlecode.com/), [source code](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/list), [API documentation](http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/rb/index.html), [wiki](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/RubyBindings) and [bug tracker](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/list) there. Another good API documentation is automatically generated at [selenium-webdriver](http://rdoc.info/gems/selenium-webdriver/) section of [rdoc.info](http://rdoc.info/) site. Looks like rdoc.info is more up to date than the official API documentation. At the moment, you should focus on API documentation and wiki. The wiki says that [Selenium::WebDriver::Driver](http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/rb/Selenium/WebDriver/Driver.html) and [Selenium::WebDriver::Element](http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/rb/Selenium/WebDriver/Element.html) are the two main classes.
