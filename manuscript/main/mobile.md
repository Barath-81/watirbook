TODO

Android and iPhone drivers will be deprecated really soon, but fortunately there are good alternatives. See [Android and iOS Support](http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2013/12/24/android-and-ios-support/) blog post at [Official Selenium Blog](http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/) for more detail. In this chapter you will learn how to test mobile browsers with tools like [Selendroid](http://selendroid.io/), [ios-driver](http://ios-driver.github.io/ios-driver/) and [Appium](http://appium.io/).
