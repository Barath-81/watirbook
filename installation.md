# Installation

Installation is not complicated, but unfortunately, it is not trivial either.

I have already said that Watir is "just" a piece of software written in Ruby, so to install it, you have to install Ruby first. Since both Ruby and Watir are available on Windows, Mac and Linux. Each of them has several releases (or in case of Linux, both distributions and released) currently in use, I will cover what I think is the relevant ones. Ruby has two relevant releases, 1.8.7 and 1.9.2. At the moment Watir works only on 1.8.7.

I am installing everything in VMware Fusion (Version 3.1.2 332101) virtual machines, except Mac OS, since it does not want to be virtualized. Host machine for VMware Fusion is MacBook Pro, Mac OS X 10.6.6, processor 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, Memory 4 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM.

## Windows XP
## Windows Vista
## Windows 7
## Mac OS X 10.5

It was easier for me to install Mac OS to a real machine instead to a virtual one, because Mac OS does not want to be virtualized.

Host machine is Mac mini, processor 2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, memory 4 GB 1067 MHz DDR3. 

## Mac OS X 10.6
## Ubuntu Linux 10.10
