# HTML Elements Supported by Watir

Different Watir gems support different HTML elements. For example, watir-webdriver gem supports all elements. Yes, all of them. Watir gem supports the most common ones, but as you will see later in the book, it is easy to extend it to support more elements.

The table lists all HTML elements from [HTML Standard](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/section-index.html#elements-1) page. If the cell is green then the gem supports both element and collection. If the cell is yellow then it supports only the element. If the cell is white then neither element nor collection are supported.
