# HTML Elements Supported by Watir

The table lists all HTML elements from [HTML Standard](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/section-index.html#elements-1) page. If the cell is green then the gem supports both element and collection. If the cell is yellow then it supports only the element. If the cell is white then neither element nor collection are supported.

(Insert elements.htm here.)
