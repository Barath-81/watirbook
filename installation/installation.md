# Installation

Installation is not complicated, but unfortunately, it is not trivial either.

The tools that we will be using in the book are available on Windows, Mac and Linux, and each of them has several releases currently in use (or in case of Linux, both distributions and releases). Just the most recent releases of each operating system will be covered in the book.

Everything is tested using VirtualBox 4.3.6 virtual machines, except Mac OS, since it does not want to be virtualized. Host OS for VirtualBox is Mac OS X 10.9.1.

You will probably be bored to tears if you read all installation chapters. A lot of stuff is repeated. Read only the chapters you need.
