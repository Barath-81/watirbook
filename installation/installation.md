# Installation

Installation is not complicated, but unfortunately, it is not trivial either.

I have already said that Watir is "just" a piece of software written in Ruby, so to install it, you have to install Ruby first. Since both Ruby and Watir are available on Windows, Mac and Linux and each of them has several releases currently in use (or in case of Linux, both distributions and releases), I will cover what I think is the relevant ones. Ruby has two relevant releases, 1.8.7 and 1.9.2.

I am installing everything in VMware Fusion virtual machines (Version 3.1.2 332101), except Mac OS, since it does not want to be virtualized. Host OS for VMware Fusion is Mac OS X 10.6.7.
