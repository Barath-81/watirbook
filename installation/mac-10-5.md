*Mac OS X 10.5 default desktop*

Machine is a clean installation of Mac OS X 10.5.8, fully patched, with 4 GB RAM. Safari 5.0.6. All browsers are English (US) version.

### Ruby

Regarding installing Ruby on Mac, I have good news and bad news. Good news is that Ruby is already installed by default, so you can skip this step if you just want to try Watir. Bad news is that you have an old version of Ruby installed. It will be good enough for trying Watir, but if you decide you want to use it, you will probably want to install a newer version of Ruby. So, for now, I will skip Ruby installation. I will cover it later.

To check if Ruby is installed on your Mac, open Terminal application (located in Applications/Utilities) any type `ruby -v`:

    $ ruby -v
    ruby 1.8.6 (2009-06-08 patchlevel 369) [universal-darwin9.0]

Ruby 1.8.6 is pretty old, as the date says (2009). Does not matter at the moment, you can install newer version of Ruby later.

### RubyGems

With RubyGems, the same story as with Ruby. It is already installed, but an old version. Let's see which version is here with `gem -v`:

    $ gem -v
    1.0.1

RubyGems 1.0.1 is pretty old. Watir needs never version. Fortunately, it should be easy to upgrade RubyGems with `sudo gem update --system`:

    $ sudo gem update --system
    (...)
    Updating RubyGems...
    ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::RemoteSourceException)
    HTTP Response 302 fetching http://gems.rubyforge.org/yaml

Now you see why I said "should be easy". RubyGems 1.0.1 is so old, it could not even be updated the easy way. See how lucky you are to have this book? Of course there is a way to upgrade to the newer version of RubyGems. The latest version I could install or Ruby 1.8.6 is RubyGems 1.4.2. Download [rubygems-update 1.4.2 gem] (click *Download* link), open Terminal window in folder where you have downloaded it (`/Users/zeljko/Downloads` in my case) and install it:

    $ sudo gem install -l rubygems-update-1.4.2.gem
    Successfully installed rubygems-update-1.4.2
    1 gem installed
    Installing ri documentation for rubygems-update-1.4.2...
    Installing RDoc documentation for rubygems-update-1.4.2...

    $ sudo update_rubygems
    RubyGems 1.4.2 installed
    File not found: README

Ignore `File not found: README`. Check if RubyGems is updated:

    $ gem -v
    1.4.2

Everything is as it should be.
