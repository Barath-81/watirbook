## Mac OS X 10.6

![Mac OS X 10.6 default desktop](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/watirbook/raw/master/images/installation/mac-10-6/desktop.png)\

*Mac OS X 10.6 default desktop*

Machine is a clean installation of Mac OS X 10.6.7, fully patched, with 4 GB RAM. Safari 5.0.5, Firefox 4.0.1. or 3.6.17, Chrome 11.0.696.68, Opera 11.10. All browsers are English (US) version.

### Ruby

Regarding installing Ruby on Mac, I have good news and bad news. Good news is that Ruby is already installed by default, so you can skip this step if you just want to try Watir. Bad news is that you have an old version of Ruby installed. It will be good enough for trying Watir, but if you decide you want to use it, you will probably want to install a newer version of Ruby. So, for now, I will skip Ruby installation. I will cover it later.

To check if Ruby is installed on your Mac, open Terminal application (located in `/Applications/Utilities`) any type `ruby -v`:

    $ ruby -v
    ruby 1.8.7 (2009-06-12 patchlevel 174) [universal-darwin10.0]

You should get the same result as I did. Ruby 1.8.7 patchlevel 174 (released June 12, 2009). That is actually not so bad.

### RubyGems

With RubyGems, the same story as with Ruby. It is already installed, but an old version. Let's see which version is here with `gem -v`:

    $ gem -v
    1.3.5

1.3.5 is pretty old. Watir needs never version. Fortunately, it is easy to upgrade RubyGems with `sudo gem update --system`:

    $ sudo gem update --system
    (...)
    RubyGems 1.8.2 installed
    (...)

### Xcode 3.2

You will need Xcode from Apple if you want to install watir-webdriver or safariwatir gems. You do not need it for firewatir gem.

The easiest way to install Xcode is from Mac OS DVD. Insert the DVD, go to *Optional Installs* folder and double click *Xcode.mpkg* file.

![Install Xcode 3.2 from Mac OS DVD](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/watirbook/raw/master/images/installation/mac-10-6/xcode-dvd.png)\

*Install Xcode 3.2 from Mac OS DVD*

You can get a newer version from Apple web site. You will need Apple ID. It is username and password you already use for iTunes Store or Mac App Store. If you do not have Apple ID, you can create one for free. Sign in with your Apple ID at [Xcode] site and on the bottom right you will see *Looking for Xcode 3? Download Now*. Download *Xcode 3.2.6 and iOS SDK 4.3 (Disk Image)*. Please notice it is 4.1 GB.

You can get the newest Xcode 3.2 without Apple ID and without downloading 4 GB file. Install Xcode 3.2 from Mac OS DVD and run Software Update. It will update Xcode to 3.2.6, and downloaded file will be "just" about 600 MB.

### Xcode 4

According to Xcode site, Xcode 4 "is a free download for all members of the iOS and Mac Developer Programs". Both programs are $99/year. If you are not a member of mentioned programs (I am not), you can buy it from Mac App Store for $4.99. But, since you can install Xcode 3 for free, there is no need to buy anything.

### watir-webdriver

The first gem we will install is watir-webdriver. For now it can drive Firefox and Chrome on Mac. Soon it should also be able to drive Safari and Opera. Install it with `sudo gem install watir-webdriver --no-ri --no-rdoc`.

If you did not install Xcode, you will get this:

    $ sudo gem install watir-webdriver --no-ri --no-rdoc
    (...)
    Fetching: ffi-1.0.7.gem (100%)
    (...)
    Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
    ERROR:  Error installing watir-webdriver:

    Results logged to /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/ffi-1.0.7/ext/ffi_c/gem_make.out

Fortunately, it is easy to fix. Install Xcode 3 or 4 (see previous chapters).

Try again:

    $ sudo gem install watir-webdriver --no-ri --no-rdoc
    (...)
    Successfully installed watir-webdriver-0.2.3
    (...)

To drive [Firefox] or [Chrome], make sure you have them installed.

### Firefox with watir-webdriver

Let's try to drive Firefox! Open our old friend IRB and type this:

    $ irb

    > require "rubygems"
    => false

    > require "watir-webdriver"
    => true

    > browser = Watir::Browser.new :ff
    => #<Watir::Browser:0x10101ee40 url="about:blank" title="">

    > browser.goto "watir.com"
    => "http://watir.com/"

Great! We can drive Firefox.

### Chrome with watir-webdriver

Let's see if it can really drive Chrome too. Just continue typing in IRB:

    > browser = Watir::Browser.new :chrome
    Selenium::WebDriver::Error::WebDriverError: Unable to find the chromedriver executable. Please download the server from http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list and place it somewhere on your PATH. More info at http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver.
    from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/selenium-webdriver-0.2.0/lib/selenium/webdriver/chrome/service.rb:18:in `executable_path'

    from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/selenium-webdriver-0.2.0/lib/selenium/webdriver/common/driver.rb:33:in `new'
    from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/selenium-webdriver-0.2.0/lib/selenium/webdriver/common/driver.rb:33:in `for'
    from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/selenium-webdriver-0.2.0/lib/selenium/webdriver.rb:74:in `for'
    from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/watir-webdriver-0.2.3/lib/watir-webdriver/browser.rb:35:in `initialize'
    from (irb):6:in `new'
    from (irb):6

Uh oh. Looks like there is a problem. I know a new Chrome driver is released recently, and it looks like it is not as easy to install at the moment. So I will leave this for later when I have some time to play with it. I hope they will fix it soon, so I do not have to do anything.

### Safari with safariwatir

Safari is installed by default on Mac OS X, so you do not have to install it. You do have to install Xcode 3 or 4 (see previous chapters).

If you do not have Xcode installed, you will get this error message if you try to install safariwatir:

    $ sudo gem install safariwatir --no-ri --no-rdoc
    (...)
    Fetching: rb-appscript-0.6.1.gem (100%)
    Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
    ERROR:  Error installing safariwatir:

    Results logged to /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/rb-appscript-0.6.1/./gem_make.out

Install Xcode 3 or 4 and try again:

    $ sudo gem install safariwatir --no-ri --no-rdoc
    (...)
    Successfully installed safariwatir-0.4.0
    (...)

Let's try safariwatir. Open IRB:

    $ irb
    >>

Require RubyGems and safariwatir gem:

    require "rubygems"
    => false
    require "safariwatir"
    => true

Open Safari browser:

    browser = Watir::Safari.new
    => #<Watir::Safari:0x10116fc68 @scripter=#<Watir::AppleScripter:0x10116fbf0 @js=#<Watir::JavaScripter:0x10116fc18>, @typing_lag=0.08, @app=app("/Applications/Safari.app"), @document=app("/Applications/Safari.app").documents[1], @appname="Safari">>

Go to google.com:

    browser.goto "http://google.com"
    => nil

It works! :)

### Firefox with firewatir

> *Chapter on firewatir will not be updated, since I consider firewatir dead. All updates go to watir-webdriver chapter. I did not delete this chapter because it could help somebody, sometime, maybe.*

![Firefox 3.6 on Mac OS 10.6](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/watirbook/raw/master/images/installation/mac-10-6/firefox-3-6.png)\

*Firefox 3.6 on Mac OS 10.6*

Since firewatir gem can not drive Firefox 4, install [Firefox 3.6]. If you need to drive Firefox 4, use watir-webdriver gem.

You also need Firefox plugin that allows firewatir gem to control Firefox. Install [jssh] plugin for Firefox 3.6 from Watir web site. Open Firefox, go to [watir.com/installation/#mac] and click link `Mac plugin for Firefox 3.6`.

If you have an older version of Firefox, install appropriate plugin. Each version has different plugin. Supported versions of Firefox are 2, 3, 3.5 and 3.6.

![Installing jssh plugin for Firefox 3.6 on Mac OS 10.6](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/watirbook/raw/master/images/installation/mac-10-6/jssh-3.png)\

*Installing jssh plugin for Firefox 3.6 on Mac OS 10.6*

Firefox will say *Firefox prevented this site (watir.com) from asking you to install software on your computer.* Click button *Allow* and then *Install Now*. 

Firefox will now say *Restart Firefox to complete your changes.* Click button *Restart Firefox*. Close Firefox when it restarts.

Install firewatir gem:

    $ sudo gem install firewatir --no-ri --no-rdoc
    (...)
    Successfully installed firewatir-1.8.1
    (...)

Let's see if everything works. Open IRB with `irb`:

    $ irb
    >>

Let Ruby know you want to use RubyGems and firewatir gem:

    require "rubygems"
    => false
    require "firewatir"
    => true

Time to open Firefox with `browser = Watir::Browser.new`:

    >> browser = Watir::Browser.new
    => #<FireWatir::Firefox:0x10182bae8 url="about:blank" title="">

You did it! Firefox opened!

Let's go to watir.com:

    browser.goto "watir.com"
    => #<FireWatir::Firefox:0x10182bae8 url="http://watir.com/" title="Watir">
