- Pop Ups: There are a lot of popups that Watir users need to deal with. The last time I checked, there were 11 different popups that we know about. Some of them can be handled by Watir with ease, some not. In this chapter you will learn what to do when you see a pop up.
- Reference: In this chapter I will do my best to summarize the book.
  - Watir Summary: The best of http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Summary
  - Watir Cheat Sheet: Something like http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Cheat+Sheet
  - Ruby Cheat Sheet: Something like http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Ruby+Cheat+Sheet
  - Watir RDoc: I am not sure about this chapter. I could be too verbose.
- Learning More: After you know the basics, you will want to learn more. This chapter will show you the way.
  - Watir: If you want to learn more about Watir, there are a lot of resources. Unfortunately, they are not easy to find. In this chapter I will list all resources I know about, including the Watir web site and wiki, Watir related articles, blogs and podcast. There is even a custom Google search engine that searches all Watir related sites, but nothing more.
  - Ruby: If you want to learn more Ruby, there are plenty of resources. Books, articles, blogs... In this chapter I will make a few suggestions where to start.
- Develop Watir: If you need to fix a bug or implement a feature, Watir can easily be extended. In this chapter you will learn how to do it. After all, that is what open source is all about. You will learn how to get the Watir source code, run unit tests, build and install the Watir gems, install development gems, how to contribute code and a few more tricks.
- Community: Contributing code is not the only way you can help. You can answer Watir related questions at Stack Overflow, Google Groups or IRC channel, submit bugs, fix, update or create documentation, to name a few.
