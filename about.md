# About Watir

What is this thing Watir, that I have decided to write a book about? The answer used to be pretty simple a few years ago, but it is not any more. Bret Pettichord (Watir co-creator) would say that it is family of Ruby libraries that drive browsers. (Ruby is a programming language, if you did not hear about it so far.) I would add to that that Watir is an [open source][open source] project. If you do not know what open source is, for now it is enough that you know that you do not have to pay anything to use it. Really, anything.

I was thinking about Watir project, and I have asked myself: "So, what is an open source project, after all?"  After a lot of thinking (and a few beers) I think I know the answer. Open source project is code, documentation and community. So simple.
