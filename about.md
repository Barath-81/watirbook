# About Watir

What is this thing Watir, that I have decided to write a book about? The answer used to be pretty simple a few years ago, but it is not any more. Bret Pettichord (Watir co-creator) would say that it is family of Ruby libraries that drive browsers. (Ruby is a programming language, if you did not hear about it so far.) I would add to that that Watir is an [open source] project. If you do not know what open source is, for now it is enough that you know that you do not have to pay anything to use it. Really, anything.

I was thinking about Watir project, and I have asked myself: "So, what is an open source project, after all?"  After a lot of thinking (and a few beers) I think I know the answer. Open source project is code, documentation and community. So simple.

# History

## Code

Watir is fairly old project. According to github.com, [the first commit] containing Ruby code was made in October 2003. That is almost 8 years ago. In internet years, it is almost a century.

As far as I can tell, the code was first in SVN repository at RubyForge, then moved to [OpenQA] and now is at [GitHub].

License it an important part of every open source project. The very first commit had the license, and as far as I can tell, it was BSD, although it was not explicitly stated.

In January 2005, when [the first version of Watir], 1.0.1, was released (according to RubyForge) as a zip file we had some code. Zip file? Really?! Really.

Watir 1.4.1 (August 2005) was a big success, downloaded almost 45k times. That was also the first version that was available as both a gem and exe file. Watir is [23rd] on the list of top RubyForge downloads, if that means anything these days.

[Watir gem] is now hosted at RubyGems.org, all gems have over 55k downloads, and the current version (1.8.1) over 2k downloads. Watir gem is not the only gem included in the Watir project, there is also [firewatir], [commonwatir], [safariwatir], [celerity], [watir-webdriver] and the youngest one, [operawatir]. There used to be [chromewatir] gem too, but it is replaced with watir-webdriver.

There are a few frameworks that simplify writing Watir code: [taza], [watircraft], [watirloo], and [watirsplash], but only the last one is updated.
