# About Me and the Book

![Željko Filipin](images/zeljko.jpg)\

Hi, my name is [Željko Filipin][zeljko]. I am a software tester, the [Watir][watir] community manager and host of the [Watir Podcast][watirpodcast]. I am also one of the organizers of [viaqa][viaqa] conference on software testing.

This is a [book on Watir][web]. It is not finished. I am working on it.

The source ([markdown][markdown]) will always be free at [github.com/zeljkofilipin/watirbook][github], [pdf][pdf] and [epub][epub] versions are $9.

A few versions of the book are currently available for free as pdf and epub files at [github.com/zeljkofilipin/watirbook/downloads][downloads].

If you think there needs to be a book on Watir and I am the right person to write it, feel free to [buy the book][buy] now. You will get all updates to the book for free. I promise I will not take the money, spend it on beer and never write the book. :)

If the book is not finished in the near future, I will return the money. Also, if you buy the book and you do not like it, I will return the money.

If you like the idea, but do not have $9, feel free to send any amount to zeljko.filipin at gmail.com via [Paypal][paypal]. You can also donate to the book via [Flattr][flattr]. Any amount is appreciated.

You can discuss the book at [groups.google.com/group/watirbook][google]. Anybody can suggest book format (currently pdf and epub, but almost anything is possible) and which chapter to write next. Of course, if you buy the book and then suggest a format/chapter, your vote will count more.

The next chapter will probably be installation, since a lot of people have problems with it. The next format will probably be [mobi][mobi].

If you are reading this at Github, [Contents][contents] page links to finished chapters. If you are reading pdf or epub version, just read on.
