#Watir Book

Hi, my name is Å½eljko Filipin. I am software tester, Watir community manager and host of Watir Podcast. This is a book on Watir. It is not finished. In fact, I have just started with it, and then life happened. I hope I will have some time to work on in the near future.

Book source is at GitHub at http://github.com/zeljkofilipin/watirbook

There is also a Google group at http://groups.google.com/group/watirbook/
